# 📋 Task: Persistent "Enter Child's Name" Button

**User Story:** As a user, after I've shared my phone number, I want to always have a clear button to add a child's name so I can easily add multiple children without restarting the conversation.

## Requirements

1.  After the user successfully provides their phone number, a persistent keyboard button should appear.
2.  The initial text for this button should be "Указать имя ребенка" (Enter child's name).
3.  Once the user has added at least one child's name, the button text should change to "Указать еще одного ребенка" (Enter another child's name).
4.  This button should remain visible to the user to allow adding more children at any point after the phone number step.
